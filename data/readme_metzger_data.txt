This directory contains an ESRI shapefile and grid for the global environmental stratification, as published in Global Ecology and Biogeography. 

You are welcome to use it, as long as you acknowledge its source and cite the Global Ecology and Biogeography paper in any arising publication:

Metzger M.J., Bunce R.G.H, Jongman R.H.G, Sayre R., Trabucco A., Zomer R. (2012). A high-resolution bioclimate map of the world: a unifying framework for global biodiversity research and monitoring. Global Ecology and Biogeography in press. DOI 10.1111/geb.12022

A further paper discussing the application of the GEnS has recently been accepted for publication:

Metzger M.J., Brus D.J., Bunce R.G.H, Carey P.D., Gon√ßalves J., Honrado J.P., Jongman R.H.G, Trabucco A., Zomer R. (2012). Environmental stratifications as the basis for national, European and global ecological monitoring. Ecological Indicators in press.

NOTE
The data provided here are not projected, ie they have a geographic latitude-longitude coordinate system. While the grid has a colormap that displays the legend discussed in the paper, the shapefile does not have a separate legend file.
